# ❤️🩺 **Heart Attack Risk Prediction using Machine Learning**  

## 🔍 **Project Overview**  
Cardiovascular diseases, including heart attacks, are among the leading causes of death worldwide. **Early prediction** of heart attack risks can save lives by enabling preventive measures. This project leverages **machine learning** 🤖 to predict a person's risk of suffering a **heart attack** based on medical and lifestyle factors.  

## 🎯 **Objective**  
The primary goal of this project is to build a **binary classification model** that:  
✅ **Predicts heart attack risk** (Low ⚪ / High 🔴).  
✅ Helps in **early diagnosis and prevention**.  
✅ Assists healthcare professionals with **data-driven insights**.  

## 📊 **Dataset**  
The dataset includes **various health indicators** related to heart disease, such as:  
🩸 **Cholesterol Levels** – High LDL levels increase the risk.  
⚖️ **BMI (Body Mass Index)** – Obesity is a major risk factor.  
💗 **Resting Blood Pressure** – Hypertension leads to heart disease.  
🚬 **Smoking & Alcohol Consumption** – Lifestyle habits influencing heart health.  
🏃 **Physical Activity Levels** – Regular exercise reduces risk.  
🩺 **Diabetes & Family History** – Genetic & medical history-based risks.  

## 🧠 **Machine Learning Approach**  
Several ML models were evaluated to achieve the best accuracy:  
✅ **Logistic Regression**  
✅ **Random Forest Classifier** 🌲  
✅ **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)**  
✅ **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**  
✅ **Neural Networks (ANN)**  

📊 **Evaluation Metrics:** Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC
